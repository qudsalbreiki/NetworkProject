Introduction
This README outlines two tasks. The first involves using Cisco Packet Tracer to demonstrate collision domains with a hub and a switch. The second requires developing a Python client-server socket program to check if a string is a palindrome. Each task includes designing, configuring, and testing the respective solutions and submitting a detailed report and demo.

Part 1: Network Design with Cisco Packet Tracer
Design and Configuration
Network Design Using Hub:

Set up a network with multiple devices connected via a hub.
Assign IP addresses to each device.
Take screenshots of the network topology.
Network Design Using Switch:

Replace the hub with a switch.
Reassign IP addresses to each device, if necessary.
Take screenshots of the updated network topology.
Testing
Hub Scenario:

Demonstrate packet collisions by sending data from multiple devices simultaneously.
Capture screenshots showing the occurrence of collisions.
Switch Scenario:

Show that the switch isolates collision domains by sending data from multiple devices.
Capture screenshots showing the absence of collisions.
Conclusion
Summarize the differences between a hub and a switch in terms of collision domains.
Highlight key learnings from designing and testing the network setups.
Part 2: Python Client-Server Socket Program
Introduction
Develop a Python client-server socket program where the client sends strings to the server, which checks if they are palindromes. The server responds with appropriate messages, and the client displays the results.

Design and Implementation
Client:

Sends a string to the server.
Displays the server's response.
Can send multiple strings in a single connection.
Sends a termination message to close the connection.
Server:

Receives strings from the client.
Checks if the strings are palindromes.
Responds with appropriate messages.
Handles multiple simultaneous connections.
Testing
Test the program with multiple connections.
Send different numbers of strings from the client.
Capture screenshots or logs of the interactions.
Conclusion
Summarize the functionality and performance of the client-server program.
Highlight key learnings from the implementation and testing phases.
